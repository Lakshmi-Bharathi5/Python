Git is a version control system that helps manage changes to code over time. To start a new Git project, initialize a Git repository in the current directory using `git init`, or download an existing repository with `git clone <repository_url>`. Once you've made changes, you can check the status of your files with `git status` to see if they’re untracked, modified, or staged. To prepare changes for a commit, add files to the staging area using `git add <file_name>` or `git add .` to stage all modified files. When ready to save changes, use `git commit -m "Commit message"` to record them in the repository with a descriptive message.

If you need to review previous commits, `git log` shows the commit history. To share your work or update the remote repository, push changes with `git push origin <branch_name>`, usually to the `main` or `master` branch. Similarly, to keep your local copy up to date with remote changes, use `git pull origin <branch_name>` to fetch and merge updates from the remote branch. For feature development or experimentation, create a new branch using `git branch <branch_name>` and switch to it with `git checkout <branch_name>`. When the work on the branch is complete, merge it into the main branch with `git merge <branch_name>`, and if it’s no longer needed, delete it with `git branch -d <branch_name>` (or `-D` to force delete).

If you need to discard local changes, `git checkout -- <file_name>` reverts the file to its last committed state. To view changes, `git diff` shows differences in the working directory or between commits. Lastly, if you're working with multiple repositories, you can set up a remote with `git remote add origin <repository_url>` to link the local project to a remote repository, making collaboration easier.
